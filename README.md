# gosteam

## Intent

gosteam aims to provide a set of functions that interact with various [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) interfaces. For example:

* Query the Steam matser server to get a list of game servers
* Query individual Steam/Source game servers for information

*Disclaimer*: I'm using this project largely as a playground for learning the [Go]() programming language. It's not at all unlikely that there are things in the codebase that are far from perfect, especially with regards to performance. If you spot a bug or stupidity somewhere, feel free to let me know and I'll try to do better.
